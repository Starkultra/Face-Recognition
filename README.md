# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
## Introduction
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection     technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing
There are a number of detectors other than the face, which can be found in the library. Feel free to experiment with them and create detectors for eyes, license plates, etc.
## Pre-requisites
- [x] Python
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Opencv
## Explanation 
 There are three .py file(face_dataset,training,face_Recognition), two folder(dataset,trainer) and one .xml file.
 face_dataset.py is used for creating database to store the captured face for training. Once face_dataset.py file is executed it caputures the image and stored in dataset folder
## Technique Used
- [x] Local Binary Pattern(LBP) classifier
- [x] Haarcascade classifier
