# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
## Introduction
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection     technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing
There are a number of detectors other than the face, which can be found in the library. Feel free to experiment with them and create detectors for eyes, license plates, etc.
